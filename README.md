# Deep-Q-Learning

This is an example of how Deep Q Learning works using the GYM library. In this project we will teach to a Reinforcement Learning model how to solve the environment of CartPole V0. The model begins knowing nothing about how the game works or what the rules are. By playing by itself and penalizing it everytime it drops the pole, it will learn eventually (at around 1000 iterations) how to balance the pole for more than 500 steps.
